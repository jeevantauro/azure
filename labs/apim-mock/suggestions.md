You can export an OpenAPI specification in APIM - from the _APIs_ view, click the ellipsis for one API. You can choose the format, and that will give you a JSON or YAML file you can share.

Users can also get this from the Developer Portal - browse the APIs, choose the one you want and you get a page very much like the original Swagger page. It has an _API definition_ dropdown which lets you export the spec.
